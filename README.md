Overview
This repository implements an Energy Trading Platform where household agents interact with each other to buy and sell energy based on their usage, savings, and market conditions. The agents are designed using the Fetch.ai framework, and the system includes mechanisms for both energy consumption and energy trading between agents in a decentralized manner.

The platform is based on two primary functionalities:

Buying Energy: Agents can buy energy if their energy production is less than their energy usage and their savings fall below a target threshold.

Selling Energy: Agents can sell energy once their savings exceed a set threshold, and the agents with the most savings will sell first.
